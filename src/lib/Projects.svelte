        During my time at First Principles Publishing, I contributed to
        valueglance.com by applying my React and Tailwind skills. I made
        meaningful contributions to the product and had the opportunity to work
        closely with the design team to enhance both functionality and design.

          This project is a Svelte x Nginx website where I showcase my film
          photography in a beautiful and engaging format. While building it, I
          explored ways to improve performance when running the site locally
          without compressing or converting my original .jpg images.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this demo, I share some of the strategies I used, like loading
          low-res versions of the images during the initial load to avoid
          overwhelming the browser with high-res downloads all at once. I also
          implemented the lazy attribute on {"<img />"} elements and used Intersection
          Observer to dynamically load high-res images as they come into view.
        </p>
        <p>
          To further optimize, I configured Nginx to enable browser caching for
          the images, ensuring that they load instantly on subsequent visits.
          This combination of techniques creates a seamless experience while
          preserving the quality of my work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I explore additional possibilities, such as converting my
          images to WebP format to significantly reduce file sizes, while
          keeping it's quality, or implementing a loading screen to enhance the
          user experience while high-resolution images are being loaded.
