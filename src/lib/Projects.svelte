        This was a freelance project in which I designed, developed, and
        deployed a wedding website for my client's big day. I collaborated
        closely with the client to adapt to evolving designs and requirements.
        Figma was used prior to development to introduce various design concepts
        and ideas to my client, as well as to help understand what wedding
        information would be provided for the guests. I began to develop the
        project using Vite and SvelteKit, which provided me with a local
        development environment, a framework for a lightweight Single Page
        Application, and routing for the various pages. SvelteKit also had a
        Netlify adapter so that I could easily deploy and build my application
        on their platform for hosting. I then went through available domain
        names on Porkbun and listed them to my client so they could choose the
        site name that most resonated with them. The client also requested for
        the site to have RSVP functionality, which I implemented using the
        Rsvpify service. This provided guests with email notifcations and
        reminders for the wedding, and provided my client with essential RSVP
        data from the guests which was used for planning. I followed best web
        practices such as semantic HTML, web accessibility, lazy loading,
        responsive design, image compression, and more.

          This project is a Svelte x Nginx website where I showcase my film
          photography in a beautiful and engaging format. While building it, I
          explored ways to improve performance when running the site locally
          without compressing or converting my original .jpg images.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this demo, I share some of the strategies I used, like loading
          low-res versions of the images during the initial load to avoid
          overwhelming the browser with high-res downloads all at once. I also
          implemented the lazy attribute on {"<img />"} elements and used Intersection
          Observer to dynamically load high-res images as they come into view.
        </p>
        <p>
          To further optimize, I configured Nginx to enable browser caching for
          the images, ensuring that they load instantly on subsequent visits.
          This combination of techniques creates a seamless experience while
          preserving the quality of my work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I explore additional possibilities, such as converting my
          images to WebP format to significantly reduce file sizes, while
          keeping it's quality, or implementing a loading screen to enhance the
          user experience while high-resolution images are being loaded.

        A fullstack application built with React, PostgreSQL, CSS, JavaScript,

        lives by creating and managing task lists. The backend leverages
        PostgreSQL with a relational database structure, including tables for
        users, tasks, rows, columns, and cell data. I implemented unique
        constraints, composite keys, and relationships to ensure data integrity,
        enabling seamless mapping of users to their custom tables and tasks. The
        Node.js express API is deployed on an Amazon EC2 instance, with Nginx
        serving as both a reverse proxy and a web server, all hosted on the same
        instance to ensure efficient and scalable performance.
